    <h1>Multi Window Communication</h1>
    <p>
      You are running OpenFin Runtime version:
      <span id="openfin-version"></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This example shows three different ways of pushing out messages from a
      single source to multiple windows.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Broadcast Channel using a Shared WebWorker</li>
      <li>Broadcast Channel from the Publisher Page</li>
      <li>
        OpenFin IAB Message Bus from the Publisher Page (only within OpenFin)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You may want to have one window/worker acting as the connection to a
      websocket and then have that push out data across multiple windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hasn't been built as an example of best practice. The goal was to
      give you a way of defining what type of message you want to share, how you
      want to share that message and if there is a threshold in milliseconds you
      do not want a message to exceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can run this example in the browser:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="./views/publisher.html" target="_blank">Launch in the Browser</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Or you can run this example in OpenFin (either a standard application or
      platform application):
    </p>
    <p>
      <openfin-link
        show-in-fin="false"
        href="fins://./config/app.platform.fin.json"
        >Launch OpenFin Platform Application</openfin-link
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <openfin-link
        show-in-fin="false"
        href="fins://./config/app.window.fin.json"
        >Launch OpenFin Windowed Application</openfin-link
      >
    </p>
  </body>
